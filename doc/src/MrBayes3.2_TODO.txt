MAXIM

 1 Make executables and install packages for Mac (convenient for repeated production of installers)
 2 Add a command readfasta <filename> that reads a FASTA file of sequences into a matrix.
 3 Make it possible to read a Nexus matrix with single-quoted taxon names.
 4 Configure file for MrBayes and Beagle (best way of distributing mrbayes with beagle) also NDEBUG

 - Make a script or find a tool which converts Latex to html 
 - Beagle GPU issues
 - Run test againgst Phycas (standard nonclock tree with some complex model, see instructions at molecularevolution.org)

 - Make SSE and Beagle versions for reported anc states
 - Add starting trees=neighbor joining (nj)
 - Look at FAST_LOG for SSE
 - Implement a shortcut that skips fully ambiguous parts of the tree (?)
 - Implement recovery from checkpoints for stepping stone (stepping stone data has to be stored to .ckp file first)
---------------------------------
 - Profiling
 - Alternative ways of scaling?


FREDRIK
 - Email to mrbayes users email list, evoldir, systematikforeningen
 - Modify and finish manual
 - Rename gibbsGamma to samplerates, restructure as ordinary parameter
 - Rename relaxed clock models: igr to igr, bm to tk02
-------------------------------------------------------
 - Introduce cppi, mixedcpp, and mixedbr models (?)
 - Introduce catrate model
 - Fill in identity or stationary matrix in TiProbs_Std() if brl is extreme 


CHI
 - Extend coalescent prior and birth-death prior to serially sampled trees
 - Introduce fossils on ancestral branches with several sampling strategies
 - rjMCMC between relaxed clock models (TK02 and IGR)
 --------------------------------------


NOT ASSIGNED
 - Make PrunePolyTree() function to handle properly relaxed model parameters.
 - Improve parsSets implementation to be safer and more memory-efficient
 - Update web site, Wiki manual, online html help
 - Test parsimony models
--------------------------------------
 - Introduce sampleomega
