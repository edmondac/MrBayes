
How to make a release of MrBayes
================================

1. Remove remains from old release.
   $svn rm --force release/src

   Copy over new examples, documentation and source files. You probably only want
   to use some of the files in the current examples and documentation folders.

   $svn copy trunk/src release/
   $svn copy examples/* release/examples/
   $svn copy documentation/* release/documentation

   After copying, increase the version number in trunk/src/bayes.h
   #define  VERSION_NUMBER  "3.2.5"

2. In release/src
   Add #define RELEASE in file bayes.h
   You can uncomment /* #define RELEASE */ on line ~40 of bayes.h)

   Modify to the right version number in statement if necessary.
   #define  VERSION_NUMBER  "3.2.4"

3. Compile and make installer for Windows (using release/src code)

   You need to have Visual Studio 2013. Use VS project at projects/visual_CZ/

   Make sure that active configuration is set to 'Release' and correct platform
   (Win32 or x64).
   Make sure SSE_ENABLED BEAGLE_ENABLED are defined, not MPI_ENABLED in bayes.h.
   (alternatively, should define in project properties)
   Make sure you link to the release version of the Beagle dlls (and libs), which will
   be located in 'C:\Program Files\Common Files\libhmsbeagle' for 64-bit version and
   'C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\libhmsbeagle' for 32-bit version.

   Use generated exes with documentation\ and examples\ to make an archive.
   Put the archive into tags/v3.2.x

   TODO: make a installer using WiX with selectable components (BEAGLE)

4. Compile and make installer for Mac (using release/src code)

   Install the latest release version of the Beagle library.

   Compile release versions in release/src on an x64 Mac (mb and mb-mpi). To make sure
   the serial version runs on OS X 10.5 and above, compile on a 10.6 machine using
   compiler option -mmacosx-version-min=10.5. The parallel version should be compiled 
   on a 10.7 or 10.8 machine and linked with the HomeBrew version of the mpi libraries.
   Move the binaries to projects/packages/
   Clean the release/src folder using 'make distclean'.

   Update the documents and texts in projects/packages/

   Use projects/packages/mb-beagle.pkgproj to produce the Mac installer with Packages.
   This will package MrBayes with the Beagle libraries installed on the machine.

   Sign the package using your Apple Developer ID Installer certificate.
   $productsign --sign 'Developer ID Installer: your name' 
         MrBayes-3.2.x_MACx64.pkg  MrBayes-3.2.x_MACx64_signed.pkg
   $pkgutil --check-signature MrBayes-3.2.5_MACx64_signed.pkg

   Put the installer package into tags/v3.2.x

5. Make a tar ball for compilation of serial and MPI version. We do this from a temporary
   folder that is deleted afterwards.

   $mkdir mrbayes_3.2.x
   $svn export --force release/src/ mrbayes_3.2.x/src/
   $svn export --force release/examples/ mrbayes_3.2.x/examples/
   $svn export --force release/documentation/ mrbayes_3.2.x/documentation
   $tar -pczf ./tags/v3.2.x/mrbayes-3.2.x.tar.gz mrbayes_3.2.x/
   $rm -r mrbayes_3.2.x

6. Commit installer files

   $svn add tags/v3.2.x/*
   $svn commit -m "Update release files"

7. Copy files to SourceForge release for download.

   Select 'Files' from the Project menu at SourceForge MrBayes site.

   Create subfolder 3.2.XX within 'mrbayes' folder, add tar ball, windows and Mac
   installers there.

   Click the "i" icon for each of the added files and put proper OS flag,
   i.e. mark only Windows for win installer, mark only Mac for mac installer,
   mark all except Mac and Win for tar ball.

8. Change the download links in the download2.php file on the SourceForge project web,
   and modify the download text in download.php as appropriate for the new release.
