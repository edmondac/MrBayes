MrBayes 3.2.7-dev (development version)

Building MrBayes using the GNU autotools (Autoconf and Automake):

*   Make sure Autoconf 2.69 is installed.
*   Make sure Automake 1.15 is installed.
*   Make sure pkg-config >=0.9.0 is installed

*   On some systems that uses metaauto for wrapping multiple versions of
    the GNU autotools:

    $ export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
    $ export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.15

*   Run autoheader to create "config.h.in" from "configure.ac":

    $ autoheader

*   Run aclocal to create "aclocal.m4" from "configure.ac":

    $ aclocal

*   Run automake to create "Makefile.in" (and other building tools) from
    "Makefile.am":

    $ automake --add-missing

*   Run autoconf to create "configure":

    $ autoconf

*   Run configure to create "Makefile" (see "./configure --help" for
    info about enabling and disabling features of MrBayes, or how to
    install in non-standard locations etc.):

    $ ./configure

*   Make the project:

    $ make

Picking up the Beagle library:

Assuming Beagle was compiled and installed in a standard location,
it will be picked up by the configure script automatically (using
the pkg-config tool).  If it isn't found, or the configure script
is run with "--without-beagle", Beagle will not be used.  If Beagle
is installed in a non-default location, point the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
environment variable to the "pkgconfig" directory that Beagle used.

For example, I installed Beagle in my home directory using

    $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
    $ make && make install

This means I will need to point PKG_CONFIG_PATH to
"$HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig" when I build MrBayes:

    $ env PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure
    [...]
    checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config
    checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
    checking for BEAGLE... yes
    [...]
    $ make && make install
