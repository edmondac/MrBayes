Test criteria

Run with data and debug version of program for a short number of generations, then append a short number of generations, finally run sumt and sump. Test:
- No Warning or Error messages
- No crash
- No proposals with excessively large or small acceptance probability (below/above 10/90%)
- No positive log likelihoods
- Final log likelihood and log prior are very similar when calculated from scratch and when based on updates
- Initial log likelihood and log prior of appended run are similar to final log likelihood and log prior of previous run
*- Reasonable output from sump and sumt
*- All consensus trees open in FigTree

Run without data for a reasonable number of generations, then run sump. Test:
- Substitution model parameters have correct mean and variance
